				<p>A native football club of active teenage boys whose play under the name of their parish church which got title Basilica.Established in September 2016. 
Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most 
popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or 
Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent 
common origins and are known as football codes.There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary
codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already 
developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was 
founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular
 team sports in the world.</p>
